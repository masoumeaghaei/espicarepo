1
00:00:11,882 --> 00:00:16,469
We survey CEOs, police officers, truck drivers, cooks, engineers.

2
00:00:16,493 --> 00:00:18,518
If people are working, we've surveyed them.

3
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:20,715
And what we know, in terms of their happiness:

4
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:22,570
workers all want the same things.

5
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,996
[The Way We Work]

6
00:00:27,247 --> 00:00:29,612
There's three billion working people in the world.

7
00:00:29,636 --> 00:00:32,525
And about 40 percent of them would say they're happy at work.

8
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,379
That means about 1.8 billion, or almost two billion people,

9
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:37,777
are not happy at work.

10
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:39,004
What does that do,

11
00:00:39,028 --> 00:00:42,253
both to those people and the organizations that they work in?

12
00:00:42,277 --> 00:00:43,705
Well, let's talk about money.

13
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:46,565
Organizations that have a lot of happy employees

14
00:00:46,589 --> 00:00:48,319
have three times the revenue growth,

15
00:00:48,343 --> 00:00:50,612
compared to organizations where that's not true.

16
00:00:50,636 --> 00:00:53,350
They outperform the stock market by a factor of three.

17
00:00:53,374 --> 00:00:55,255
And if you look at employee turnover,

18
00:00:55,279 --> 00:00:59,803
it's half that of organizations that have a lot of unhappy employees.

19
00:00:59,827 --> 00:01:01,003
The miracle thing is,

20
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:03,606
you don't have to spend more money to make this happen.

21
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,636
It's not about ping-pong tables and massages and pet walking.

22
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,898
It's not about the perks.

23
00:01:07,922 --> 00:01:10,374
It's all about how they're treated by their leaders

24
00:01:10,398 --> 00:01:12,254
and by the people that they work with.

25
00:01:12,278 --> 00:01:16,270
So I'd like to share a few ideas that create happy employees.

26
00:01:16,294 --> 00:01:17,914
Idea number one:

27
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:20,581
in organizations where employees are happy,

28
00:01:20,605 --> 00:01:22,688
what you find is two things are present:

29
00:01:22,712 --> 00:01:23,895
trust and respect.

30
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:25,443
Leaders often say,

31
00:01:25,467 --> 00:01:26,839
"We trust our employees.

32
00:01:26,863 --> 00:01:28,355
We empower our employees."

33
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,408
And then when an employee needs a laptop --

34
00:01:30,432 --> 00:01:31,854
and this is a true example --

35
00:01:31,878 --> 00:01:34,604
15 people have to approve that laptop.

36
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,922
So for the employee, all the words are right,

37
00:01:36,946 --> 00:01:40,783
but 15 levels of approval for a $1,500 laptop?

38
00:01:40,807 --> 00:01:44,038
You've actually spent more money than the laptop, on the approval.

39
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:47,783
And the employee feels maybe they're really not trusted.

40
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:52,218
So what can an organization do to have a high level of trust?

41
00:01:52,242 --> 00:01:55,168
The first organization that comes to mind is Four Seasons.

42
00:01:55,192 --> 00:01:57,866
They have magnificent properties all around the world.

43
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,415
And their employees are told,

44
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,517
"Do whatever you think is right when servicing the customer."

45
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:06,898
To hand that trust to your employees to do whatever they think is right

46
00:02:06,922 --> 00:02:08,754
makes the employees feel great.

47
00:02:08,778 --> 00:02:12,037
And this is why they're known for delivering some of the best service

48
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:13,212
in the world.

49
00:02:13,236 --> 00:02:15,776
Idea number two: fairness.

50
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,005
The thing that erodes trust in an organization

51
00:02:19,029 --> 00:02:20,543
faster than anything else

52
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:23,679
is when employees feel that they're being treated unfairly.

53
00:02:23,703 --> 00:02:25,557
Employees want to be treated the same,

54
00:02:25,581 --> 00:02:28,419
regardless of their rank or their tenure or their age

55
00:02:28,443 --> 00:02:30,733
or their experience or their job category,

56
00:02:30,757 --> 00:02:32,208
compared to anyone else.

57
00:02:32,232 --> 00:02:35,297
When I think about great organizations who get fairness right,

58
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,946
the first organization that comes to mind is Salesforce.

59
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,731
They found that men and women working in the same job

60
00:02:40,755 --> 00:02:42,485
with the same level of proficiency

61
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:44,374
were making different amounts of money.

62
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:46,755
So immediately, they calculated the difference,

63
00:02:46,779 --> 00:02:50,326
and they invested three million dollars to try and balance things out.

64
00:02:50,885 --> 00:02:53,066
Idea number three is listening.

65
00:02:53,437 --> 00:02:57,128
So, to be a listener who connects with all types of people,

66
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,239
we have to unlearn a few things.

67
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:03,231
We've all been taught about active listening and eye contact --

68
00:03:03,255 --> 00:03:04,985
an intense stare

69
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:06,731
and a compassionate look.

70
00:03:06,755 --> 00:03:07,934
That's not listening.

71
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:11,020
Repeating what the person says -- that's not listening.

72
00:03:11,044 --> 00:03:12,253
Being humble

73
00:03:12,277 --> 00:03:15,575
and always hunting and searching for the best idea possible --

74
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,035
that's what listening is.

75
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:19,695
And employees can feel whether you're doing that or not.

76
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:22,906
They want to know, when they talk to you and share an idea,

77
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,204
did you consider it when you made a decision?

78
00:03:25,228 --> 00:03:29,493
The one thing that everybody appreciates and wants when they're speaking

79
00:03:29,517 --> 00:03:33,231
is to know that what they say matters so much

80
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:35,334
you might actually change your mind.

81
00:03:35,358 --> 00:03:37,870
Otherwise, what's the point of the conversation?

82
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:41,742
We all know the things we need to change,

83
00:03:41,766 --> 00:03:43,799
the things that we need to do differently.

84
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:46,449
The way you behave, the way you treat others,

85
00:03:46,473 --> 00:03:49,755
the way you respond, the way you support,

86
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:52,525
defines the work experience for everyone around you.

87
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:54,589
Changing to be a better person --

88
00:03:54,613 --> 00:03:56,636
the world is littered with those failures.

89
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,566
But changing because there's something you believe in,

90
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,573
some purpose that you have,

91
00:04:01,597 --> 00:04:04,158
where you're willing to risk almost everything

92
00:04:04,182 --> 00:04:06,081
because it's so important to you --

93
00:04:06,105 --> 00:04:07,779
that's the reason to change.

94
00:04:07,803 --> 00:04:10,201
If it's not, you should probably find a different place to work.
