1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
HR jargon makes me crazy. 

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We have to have all these stupid acronyms that describe things that nobody understands: 

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
OKRs and PIPs. 

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
. I think we can run our businesses by just talking to each other like regular human beings. 

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We might actually get more done. 

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
[The Way We Work] 

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I really always wanted to be an HR professional, I wanted to be able to speak the language of management.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And you know what I've learned after all this time? 

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I don't think any of it matters. 

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
There's all kinds of things that we call "best practices" that aren't best practices at all.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
How do we know it's best? 

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We don't measure this stuff. 

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
In fact, I've learned that "best practices" usually means copying what everybody else does.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Our world is changing and evolving all the time.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Here are some lessons to help you adapt. 

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Lesson one: Your employees are adults. 

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You know, we've created so many layers and so many processes and so many guidelines to keep those employees in place that we've ended up with systems that treat people like they're children. 

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And they're not. 

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Fully formed adults walk in the door every single day. 

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
They have rent payments, they have obligations, they're members of society, they want to create a difference in the world. 

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So if we start with the assumption that everybody comes to work to do an amazing job , you'd be surprised what you get. 

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Lesson two: The job of management isn't to control people, it's to build great teams. 

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
When managers build great teams, here's how you know it. 

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
They've done amazing stuff. 

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Customers are really happy.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Those are the metrics that really matter. 

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Not the metrics of: "Do you come to work on time?"

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
"Did you take your vacation?" "Did you follow the rules?" 

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
"Did you ask for permission?" 

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Lesson three: People want to do work that means something. 

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
After they do it, they should be free to move on.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Careers are journeys. 

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Nobody's going to want to do the same thing for 60 years. 

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So the idea of keeping people for the sake of keeping them really hurts both of us. 

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Instead, what if we created companies that were great places to be from? 

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And everyone who leaves you becomes an ambassador for not only your product, but who you are and how you operate. 

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And when you spread that kind of excitement throughout the world, then we make all of our companies better. 

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Lesson four: Everyone in your company should understand the business. 

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Now, based on the assumption that we've got smart adults here, the most important thing we can teach them is how our business works.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:41,000
When I look at companies that are moving fast, that are really innovative and that are doing amazing things with agility and speed, it's because they're collaborative.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The best thing that we can do is constantly teach each other what we do, what matters to us, what we measure, what goodness looks like, so that we can all drive towards achieving the same thing.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Lesson five: Everyone in your company should be able to handle the truth. 

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You know why people say giving feedback is so hard? 

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
They don't practice. 

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Let's take the annual performance review.

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What else do you do in your whole life that you're really good at that you only do once a year?

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Here's what I found: 

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
humans can hear anything if it's true. 

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So let's rethink the word "feedback," and think about it as telling people the truth,  the honest truth, about what they're doing right and what they're doing wrong, in the moment when they're doing it.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That good thing you just did, whoo! 

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That's exactly what I'm talking about. 

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Go do that again. And people will do that again, today, three more times. 

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Lesson six: Your company needs to live out its values. 

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I was talking to a company not long ago, to the CEO.

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He was having trouble because the company was rocky and things weren't getting done on time, and he felt like things were sloppy. 

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This also was a man who, I observed, never showed up to any meeting on time.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Ever. If you're part of a leadership team, the most important thing that you can do to "uphold your values" is to live them.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
People can't be what they can't see. 

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We say, "Yes, we're here for equality," and then we proudly pound our chest because we'd achieved 30 percent representation of women on an executive team. 

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Well that's not equal, that's 30 percent.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Lesson seven: All start-up ideas are stupid. 

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 I spend a lot of time with start-ups, and I have a lot of friends that work in larger, more established companies.

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
They are always pooh-poohing the companies that I work with. 

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
"That is such a stupid idea." 

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Well, guess what: all start-up ideas are stupid.

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
If they were reasonable, somebody else would have already been doing them. 

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Lesson eight: Every company needs to be excited for change. Beware of the smoke of nostalgia. 

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
If you find yourself saying, "Remember the way it used to be?" 

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I want you to shift your thinking to say, "Think about the way it's going to be."

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
If I had a dream company, I would walk in the door and I would say, "Everything's changed, all bets are off. 

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We were running as fast as we can to the right, and now we'll take a hard left." 

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And everybody would go "Yes!" 

73
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's a pretty exciting world out there, and it's changing all the time. 

74
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The more we embrace it and get excited about it, the more fun we're going to have.
