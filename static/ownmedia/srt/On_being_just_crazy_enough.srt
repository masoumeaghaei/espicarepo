1
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,268
My name is Joshua Walters.

2
00:00:15,222 --> 00:00:16,217
I'm a performer.

3
00:00:19,468 --> 00:00:26,968
(Beatboxing)

4
00:00:26,887 --> 00:00:29,271
(Laughter)

5
00:00:29,218 --> 00:00:32,619
(Applause)

6
00:00:34,839 --> 00:00:41,389
But as far as being a performer, I'm also diagnosed bipolar.

7
00:00:47,835 --> 00:00:53,087
I reframe that as a positive because
the crazier I get onstage, the more entertaining I become.

8
00:00:54,589 --> 00:01:00,872
When I was 16 in San Francisco,I had my breakthrough manic episode in which I thought I was Jesus Christ.

9
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:13,468
Maybe you thought that was..you know...scary,but actually there's no amount of drugs you can take that can get you as high as if you think you're Jesus Christ

10
00:01:13,468 --> 00:01:17,470
(Laughter)

11
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:27,718
I was sent to a place, a psych ward and in the psych ward, everyone is doing their own one-man show.

12
00:01:28,468 --> 00:01:33,318
(Laughter)

13
00:01:33,318 --> 00:01:37,522
(Laughter)
There's no audience like this to justify their rehearsal time.

14
00:01:39,021 --> 00:01:40,222
They're just practicing.

15
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,269
One day they'll get here.

16
00:01:45,054 --> 00:01:51,969
Now when I got out, I was diagnosed and 
I was given medications by a psychiatrist.

17
00:01:52,756 --> 00:01:58,268
"Okay, Josh, why don't we give you some -- why don't we give you some Zyprexa.

18
00:01:58,268 --> 00:02:00,222
Okay? Mmhmm?

19
00:02:02,771 --> 00:02:04,219
At least that's what it says on my pen."

20
00:02:04,768 --> 00:02:09,421
(Laughter)

21
00:02:09,521 --> 00:02:11,621
Some of you are in the field, I can see.

22
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,470
I can feel your noise.

23
00:02:16,768 --> 00:02:28,620
The first half of high school was the struggle of the manic episode and the second half was the over medications of these drugs, where I was sleeping through high school.

24
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,869
The second half was just one big nap, pretty much, in class.

25
00:02:33,868 --> 00:02:36,688
When I got out I had a choice.

26
00:02:39,235 --> 00:02:49,238
I could either deny my mental illness or embrace my mental skillness.

27
00:02:49,338 --> 00:02:51,185
(Bugle sound)

28
00:02:53,238 --> 00:03:01,834
There's a movement going on right now to reframe mental illness as a positive -- at least the hypomanic edge part of it.

29
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:08,710
Now if you don't know what hypomania is, it's like an engine that's out of control, maybe a Ferrari engine, with no breaks.

30
00:03:09,487 --> 00:03:15,447
Many of the speakers here, many of you in the audience, have that creative edge, if you know what I'm talking about.

31
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:19,935
You're driven to do something that everyone has told you is impossible.

32
00:03:20,088 --> 00:03:22,486
And there's a book -- John Gartner.

33
00:03:22,586 --> 00:03:31,935
John Gartner wrote this book called "The Hypomanic Edge" in which
Christopher Columbus and Ted Turner and Steve Jobs and all these business minds have this edge to compete.

34
00:03:32,486 --> 00:03:48,189
A different book was written not too long ago in the mid-90s called "Touched With Fire" by Kay Redfield Jamison in which it was looked at in a creative sense in which Mozart and Beethoven and Van Gogh all have this manic depression that they were suffering with.

35
00:03:48,488 --> 00:03:50,188
Some of them committed suicide.

36
00:03:50,587 --> 00:03:54,189
So it wasn't all the good side of the illness.

37
00:03:55,734 --> 00:04:01,185
Now recently, there's been development in this field.

38
00:04:01,185 --> 00:04:07,436
And there was an article written in the New York Times, September 2010, that stated:

39
00:04:09,636 --> 00:04:10,689
"Just Manic Enough."

40
00:04:11,488 --> 00:04:39,185
Just be manic enough in which investors who are looking for entrepreneurs that have this kind of spectrum-- you know what I'm talking about -- not maybe full bipolar, but they're in the bipolar spectrum where on one side, maybe you think you're Jesus, and on the other side maybe they just make you a lot of money.

41
00:04:39,185 --> 00:04:43,138
(Laughter)

42
00:04:42,938 --> 00:04:43,438
Your call.

43
00:04:43,688 --> 00:04:44,188
Your call.

44
00:04:45,238 --> 00:04:46,838
And everyone's somewhere in the middle.

45
00:04:47,738 --> 00:04:49,338
Everyone's somewhere in the middle.

46
00:04:49,988 --> 00:05:01,622
So maybe, you know, there's no such thing as crazy, and being diagnosed with a mental illness doesn't mean you're crazy.

47
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:09,122
But maybe it just means you're more sensitive to what most people can't see or feel.

48
00:05:10,272 --> 00:05:14,118
Maybe no one's really crazy.

49
00:05:14,318 --> 00:05:17,270
Everyone is just a little bit mad.

50
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:28,621
How much depends on where you fall in the spectrum.

51
00:05:30,768 --> 00:05:34,871
How much depends on how lucky you are.

52
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,390
Thank you.

53
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:43,369
(Applause)
