<font> We survey CEOs, police officers, truck drivers, cooks, engineers. </font>
<font> If people are working, we've surveyed them. </font>
<font> And what we know, <span>in terms of their happiness</span>: </font>
<font> workers all want the same things. </font>
<font> [The Way We Work] </font>
<font> <span>There's three billion working people</span> in the world. </font>
<font> And about 40 percent of them would say they're happy <span>at work</span>. </font>
<font> That means about 1.8 billion, or almost two billion people, </font>
<font> are not happy at work. </font>
<font> What does that do, </font>
<font> both to those people and <span>the organizations that they work in</span>? </font>
<font> Well, let's talk about money. </font>
<font> Organizations that have a lot of happy employees </font>
<font> have three times the revenue growth, </font>
<font> compared to organizations where that's not true. </font>
<font> They outperform the stock market by <span>a factor of three</span>. </font>
<font> And if you look at employee turnover, </font>
<font> it's half that of organizations that have a lot of unhappy employees. </font>
<font> The miracle thing is, </font>
<font> you don't have to <span>spend more money to</span> make this happen. </font>
<font> It's not about ping-pong tables and massages and pet walking. </font>
<font> It's not about the perks. </font>
<font> It's all about how they're <span>treated by their leaders</span> </font>
<font> and by the people that they work with. </font>
<font> So I'd like to share a few ideas that <span>create happy employees</span>. </font>
<font> Idea number one: </font>
<font> in organizations where employees are happy, </font>
<font> what you find is two things are present: </font>
<font> trust and respect. </font>
<font> Leaders often say, </font>
<font> "<span>We trust our employees</span>. </font>
<font> <span>We empower our employees</span>." </font>
<font> And then when an employee needs a laptop -- </font>
<font> and this is a <span>true example</span> -- </font>
<font> 15 people have to approve that laptop. </font>
<font> So for the employee, all the words are right, </font>
<font> but 15 levels of approval for a $1,500 laptop? </font>
<font> You've actually spent more money than the laptop, on the approval. </font>
<font> And the employee feels maybe they're really not trusted. </font>
<font> So what can an organization do to have a high level of trust? </font>
<font> The first organization that <span>comes to mind</span> is Four Seasons. </font>
<font> They have magnificent properties all around the world. </font>
<font> And their employees are told, </font>
<font> "Do whatever you think is right <span>when servicing the customer.</span>" </font>
<font> To hand that trust to your employees to do whatever they think is right </font>
<font> <span>makes the employees feel great.</span> </font>
<font> And this is why <span>they're known for delivering some of the best service</span> </font>
<font> <span>in the world</span>. </font>
<font> Idea number two: fairness. </font>
<font> The thing that erodes trust in an organization </font>
<font> <span>faster than anything else</span> </font>
<font> is when employees feel that <span>they're being treated unfairly.</span> </font>
<font> Employees want to be treated <span>the same</span>, </font>
<font> regardless of their rank or their tenure or their age </font>
<font> or their experience or their job category, </font>
<font> compared to anyone else. </font>
<font> When I think about great organizations who get fairness right, </font>
<font> the first organization that comes to mind is Salesforce. </font>
<font> They found that men and women working in the same job </font>
<font> with the same level of proficiency </font>
<font> were <span>making different amounts of money.</span> </font>
<font> So immediately, they calculated the difference, </font>
<font> and they invested three million dollars to try and <span>balance things out</span>. </font>
<font> Idea number three is listening. </font>
<font> So, to be a listener who connects with all types of people, </font>
<font> we have to unlearn a few things. </font>
<font> We've all been taught about active listening and eye contact -- </font>
<font> an intense stare </font>
<font> and a compassionate look. </font>
<font> That's not listening. </font>
<font> Repeating what the person says -- that's not listening. </font>
<font> Being humble </font>
<font> and always hunting and searching for the best idea possible -- </font>
<font> that's what listening is. </font>
<font> And employees can feel whether you're doing that or not. </font>
<font> They want to know, when they talk to you and <span>share an idea</span>, </font>
<font> did you consider it when you <span>made a decision</span>? </font>
<font> The one thing that everybody appreciates and wants when they're speaking </font>
<font> is to know that <span>what they say matters</span> so much </font>
<font> you might actually <span>change your mind.</span> </font>
<font> Otherwise, what's the point of the conversation? </font>
<font> We all know the things we need to change, </font>
<font> the things that we need to do differently. </font>
<font> The way you behave, the way you treat others, </font>
<font> the way you respond, the way you support, </font>
<font> defines the work experience for everyone around you. </font>
<font> Changing to be a better person -- </font>
<font> the world is littered with those failures. </font>
<font> But changing because there's something you believe in, </font>
<font> some purpose that you have, </font>
<font> where <span>you're willing to risk almost everything</span> </font>
<font> because <span>it's so important to you</span> -- </font>
<font> that's the reason to change. </font>
<font> If it's not, you should probably find a different place to work. </font>
